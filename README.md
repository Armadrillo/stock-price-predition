• Python, NumPy, Scikit-learn enabled efficient handling of numerical arrays, machine learning tasks, and
  establishing a linear relationship for successful stock price prediction.
• Matplotlib and Seaborn enhanced data representation and analysis through visualizations in the stock price
  prediction project.
• Linear regression and SVR techniques were applied in the stock price prediction model for accurate forecasting and
  decision-making using historical data.
• Achieved an impressive accuracy of 0.999 when evaluating the model’s performance.
